# VOIP SAAS Voice Comparison
<h1>Project Details</h1>

<h2>Embedded Project in CHappie: VOIP SAAS Voice Comparison</h2>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project is embedded within CHappie, focusing on the VOIP SAAS domain. The primary objective is to perform voice comparison between agents and customers in real-time. The system separates the voices of the agent and customer, compares the agent's speech with a predefined contract made between the agent and customer, and ensures that the agent follows the specified rules during communication.</p>

<h2>Project Scope</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Voice Separation:</strong> Utilizes advanced audio processing techniques to separate the voices of agents and customers during VOIP communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Voice Comparison:</strong> Compares the speech of the agent with a contract established between the agent and the customer.</li>
    <li><strong>Rule Compliance:</strong> Verifies that the agent adheres to the predefined rules and guidelines during the communication process.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Analysis:</strong> Performs the entire voice comparison and rule compliance checks in real-time for immediate feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Integration with CHappie</h2>
<p>This project is seamlessly integrated into CHappie, a larger project focusing on various aspects of VOIP SAAS. The voice comparison functionality adds an extra layer of security and compliance to ensure smooth and rule-abiding communication between agents and customers.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Audio Processing:</strong> Advanced audio processing algorithms for voice separation and analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Utilizes speech recognition techniques to compare agent's speech with contractual terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Rule Verification:</strong> Implements rule-checking mechanisms to ensure agent compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Processing:</strong> Enables real-time analysis of VOIP communication for immediate feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Outcome</h2>
<p>The embedded project within CHappie enhances the overall functionality of the VOIP SAAS system by providing a sophisticated voice comparison and rule compliance verification mechanism. This ensures a secure and rule-abiding communication environment between agents and customers.</p>
